      <p> Sharif’s poem about their uncle talks not only about his time in the military, but about the life he left behind. Sharif emphasizes the humanity in her uncle and in turn that of other soldiers. Their descriptions of the photos of him during wartime detail different parts of his body, and what they may be doing. This motif is present throughout the entire piece, the author uses it to describe the settings in this poem. It’s a unique and beautiful way of describing a scene that highlights the people and their emotions without stating what they feel or much at all about the surrounding environment. </p>

    <p>Sharif’s use of army prose in a distinct font has the opposite effect of their descriptions of the pictures. The words used feel impersonal and lack empathy, a stark contrast from Sharif’s delicate narration of their uncle’s experiences. The fact that this style is only introduced later in the piece makes the army’s words even more impactful. The way it’s introduced is perceived as harsh and jarring.</p>

<p> Overall this poem is very effective in describing the effects of war, not only on the soldiers and their families but on the civilians whose lives are disrupted by the conflict. It shows the audience that there is no winner in war, everybody loses.</p>
